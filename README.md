Rolling the dice just for fun!
The idea is to generate a big entropy value by all involved users in one current session, and when Admin stopping the count the service summarize a general entropy of all users and just make it MOD 6!
Entropy in mathematical statistics - a measure of the uncertainty of the probability distribution.

Why Blazor?
That's something new for me and whan to try to build something very simple but interesting. Even without Authentication/Authorization (but will be useful!)
Clients - are any popular browsers Chrome/Firefox/Edge, even will work on iOS and Android

There is no Database, no 3rd party storages. Just local session!

Users adding any messages and as many as they want
Users could also update their username in current session
Users can see current statistics of their entropy details such as size and value in percent
And can see the result of the Rilling the Dice when admin clicking on Stop the Count!

Have a fun time!
